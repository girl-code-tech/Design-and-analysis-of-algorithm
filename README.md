# Design-and-analysis-of-algorithm



This is basically a repository of the assignments we have received for the course of "Design and Analysis of Algorithms". Through these codes, we have created a better understanding of how can we think analytically for working of algorithms, and also design them!



# GCD Problem: variable size decrease
In the variable-size-decrease variety of decrease-and-conquer, the size-reduction pattern varies from one iteration of an algorithm to another.
Problem: 
*Greatest common divisor of two nonnegative, not-both-zero integers m and n, denoted gcd(m,n), is defined as the largest integer that divides both m and n evenly, i.e., with a remainder of zero.


# Min_number_of_cuts: decrease by a constant factor
*Cutting a stick A stick n inches long needs to be cut into n 1-inch pieces. Outline an algorithm that performs this task with the minimum number of cuts if several pieces of the stick can be cut at the same time. Also give a formula for the minimum number of cuts.
4. Code the problem in C#
5. Show the tree of recursive calls if you use recursion
6. Find time and space complexity


# Fibonacci: Recursion
*Compute the nth Fibonacci number. 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ...
1. Using recursion write code for computing the nth Fibonacci number in C#
2. Show the tree of recursive calls
3. Find time and space complexity (use both substitution and recursive tree method)


# TeamOrdering: decrease by a constant
Team ordering You have the results of a completed round-robin tournament in which n teams played each other once. Each game ended either with a victory for one of the
teams or with a tie. Design an algorithm that lists the teams in a sequence so that every team did not lose the game with the team listed immediately after it.
